About:
----------

The word embeddings found in this package are genearated using symmetric patterns.
The embeddings can also be found in: http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~roys02/papers/sp_embeddings/sp_embeddings.html

A complete description of the embeddings appears in the paper:
Roy Schwartz, Roi Reichart and Ari Rappoport, "Symmetric Pattern Based Word Embeddings for Improved Word Similarity Prediction", in proc. of CoNLL 2015.

The published embeddings lead to state-of-the-art results on the SimLex999 dataset.

The embeddings are slightly different from the ones described on the paper:
First, the vectors in the papers were generated using the entire lexicon as features (around 200K words). 
In order to reduce the size of the vectors, we publish vectors of size 10K only). 
This actually leads to a further 1-1.5 increase in our embeddings' performance.

Moreover, we also publish a dense version of our vectors, generated using the random projection algorithm (we used the scikit python package, http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/random_projection.html).
We publish both vectors of size 300 and 500. Results using these vectors are slightly inferior compared to the original (sparse) vectors.
