About:
----------

This package includes a conversion script from the constituent format used in the Penn Treebank into dependency trees.
The resulting scheme is the most learnable scheme, as described in the paper:
"Learnability-based Syntactic Annotation Design"
by Roy Schwartz, Omri Abend and Ari Rappoport.

This code is an extension of the pennconverter script, generously provided by Richard Johansson
(http://nlp.cs.lth.se/software/treebank_converter/).
For convenience of usage, we removed most of the configuration options, so the script only allows to generate the most learnable scheme discovered in the paper above.
For a more flexible version of the script, please use the original pennconverter script from the link above.
