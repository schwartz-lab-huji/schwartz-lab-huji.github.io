Speculative decoding (SD) methods offer substantial efficiency gains by generating multiple tokens using a single target forward pass. However, existing SD approaches require the drafter and target models to share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the pool of possible drafters, often necessitating the training of a drafter from scratch. We present three new SD methods that remove this shared-vocabulary constraint. All three methods preserve the target distribution (i.e., they are lossless) and work with off-the-shelf models without requiring additional training or modifications. Empirically, on summarization, programming, and long-context tasks, our algorithms achieve significant speedups over standard autoregressive decoding. By enabling any off-the-shelf model to serve as drafter and requiring no retraining, this work substantially broadens the applicability of the SD framework in practice.","tags":["greenai"],"title":"Accelerating LLM Inference with Lossless Speculative Decoding Algorithms for Heterogeneous Vocabularies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guy Kaplan","Matanel Oren","Yuval Reif","\u003cb\u003eRoy Schwartz\u003c/b\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1737504000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1737504000,"objectID":"3d538f85e82a282bb4242f2ba0c47987","permalink":"/publication/token2word/","publishdate":"2025-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/token2word/","section":"publication","summary":"Natural language is composed of words, but modern LLMs process sub-words as input. A natural question raised by this discrepancy is whether LLMs encode words internally, and if so how. We present evidence that LLMs engage in an intrinsic detokenization process, where sub-word sequences are combined into coherent word representations. Our experiments show that this process takes place primarily within the early and middle layers of the model. They also show that it is robust to non-morphemic splits, typos and perhaps importantly\u0026mdash;to out-of-vocabulary words: when feeding the inner representation of such words to the model as input vectors, it can 'understand' them despite never seeing them during training. Our findings suggest that LLMs maintain a latent vocabulary beyond the tokenizer's scope. These insights provide a practical, finetuning-free application for expanding the vocabulary of pre-trained models. By enabling the addition of new vocabulary words, we reduce input length and inference iterations, which reduces both space and model latency, with little to no loss in model accuracy.","tags":["understanding_models"],"title":"From Tokens to Words: on the Inner Lexicon of LLMs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amit Ben Artzy","\u003cb\u003eRoy Schwartz\u003c/b\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1725753600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725753600,"objectID":"677579bf1db36a6f709efb89a0da4196","permalink":"/publication/attend_first/","publishdate":"2024-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/attend_first/","section":"publication","summary":"In decoder-based LLMs, the representation of a given layer serves two purposes: as input to the next layer during the computation of the current token; and as input to the attention mechanism of future tokens. In this work, we show that the importance of the latter role might be overestimated. To show that, we start by manipulating the representations of previous tokens; e.g. by replacing the hidden states at some layer k with random vectors. Our experimenting with four LLMs and four tasks show that this operation often leads to small to negligible drop in performance. Importantly, this happens if the manipulation occurs in the top part of the model\u0026mdash;k is in the final 30-50% of the layers. In contrast, doing the same manipulation in earlier layers might lead to chance level performance. We continue by switching the hidden state of certain tokens with hidden states of other tokens from another prompt; e.g., replacing the word \"Italy\" with \"France\" in \"What is the capital of Italy?\". We find that when applying this switch in the top 1\u0026frasl;3 of the model, the model ignores it (answering \"Rome\"). However if we apply it before, the model conforms to the switch (\"Paris\").

Providing quality control over them is crucial for scientists and, ultimately, for the public good. In modern science, this process is largely delegated to peer review -- a distributed procedure in which each submission is evaluated by several independent experts in the field. Peer review is widely used, yet it is hard, time-consuming, and prone to error. Since the artifacts involved in peer review -- manuscripts, reviews, discussions -- are largely text-based, Natural Language Processing has great potential to improve reviewing. As the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled NLP assistance for many new tasks, the discussion on machine-assisted peer review is picking up the pace. Yet, where exactly is help needed, where can NLP help, and where should it stand aside? The goal of our paper is to provide a foundation for the future efforts in NLP for peer-reviewing assistance. We discuss peer review as a general process, exemplified by reviewing at AI conferences. We detail each step of the process from manuscript submission to camera-ready revision, and discuss the associated challenges and opportunities for NLP assistance, illustrated by existing work. We then turn to the big challenges in NLP for peer review as a whole, including data acquisition and licensing, operationalization and experimentation, and ethical issues. To help consolidate community efforts, we create a companion repository that aggregates key datasets pertaining to peer review. Finally, we issue a detailed call for action for the scientific community, NLP and AI researchers, policymakers, and funding bodies to help bring the research in NLP for peer review forward. We hope that our work will help set the agenda for research in machine-assisted scientific quality control in the age of AI, within the NLP community and beyond.","tags":null,"title":"What Can Natural Language Processing Do for Peer Review?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003ca href='https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=96pR-j0AAAAJ\u0026hl=en' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eJonathan Mamou\u003c/a\u003e","\u003ca href='https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/bios/oren-pereg.html' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eOren Pereg\u003c/a\u003e","Daniel Korat","Moshe Berchansky","Nadav Timor","\u003ca href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/moshe-wasserblat-8977632/?originalSubdomain=il' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMoshe Wasserblat\u003c/a\u003e","\u003cb\u003eRoy Schwartz\u003c/b\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1715126400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715126400,"objectID":"0c686123fdc9eaba5e80ae270ee97668","permalink":"/publication/accelerating_speculative/","publishdate":"2024-05-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/accelerating_speculative/","section":"publication","summary":"Speculative decoding is a promising method for reducing the inference latency of large language models.

However, larger models also require significantly more time and compute during inference. This begs the question: what happens when both models operate under the same budget? (e.g., compute, run-time). To address this question, we analyze code generation LLMs of various sizes and make comparisons such as running a 70B model once vs. generating five outputs from a 13B model and selecting one. Our findings reveal that, in a standard unit-test setup, the repeated use of smaller models can yield consistent improvements, with gains of up to 15% across five tasks. On the other hand, in scenarios where unit-tests are unavailable, a ranking-based selection of candidates from the smaller model falls short of the performance of a single output from larger ones. Our results highlight the potential of using smaller models instead of larger ones, and the importance of studying approaches for ranking LLM outputs.","tags":["greenai","multimodality"],"title":"The Larger the Better?

In this study, we evaluate different approaches to quantifying label bias in a model's predictions, conducting a comprehensive investigation across 279 classification tasks and ten LLMs. Our investigation reveals substantial label bias in models both before and after debiasing attempts, as well as highlights the importance of outcomes-based evaluation metrics, which were not previously used in this regard.

The method works by maintaining multiple classifiers of different capacities, and allocating resources to each test instance according to its difficulty. In this work, we compare the two main approaches for adaptive inference, Early-Exit and Multi-Model, when training data is limited. First, we observe that for models with the same architecture and size, individual Multi-Model classifiers outperform their Early-Exit counterparts by an average of 2.3%. We show that this gap is caused by Early-Exit classifiers sharing model parameters during training, resulting in conflicting gradient updates of model weights. We find that despite this gap, Early-Exit still provides a better speed-accuracy trade-off due to the overhead of the Multi-Model approach. To address these issues, we propose SWEET (Separating Weights for Early-Exit Transformers) an Early-Exit fine-tuning method that assigns each classifier its own set of unique model weights, not updated by other classifiers. We compare SWEET's speed-accuracy curve to standard Early-Exit and Multi-Model baselines and find that it outperforms both methods at fast speeds while maintaining comparable scores to Early-Exit at slow speeds. Moreover, SWEET individual classifiers outperform Early-Exit ones by 1.1% on average.

We introduce an evaluation framework defined by a bias-amplified training set and an anti-biased test set, both automatically extracted from existing datasets.

Furthermore, we use human annotations to create a gold-standard dataset of 3,820 validated analogies. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art models do well when distractors are chosen randomly (~86%), but struggle with carefully chosen distractors (~53%, compared to 90% human accuracy). We hope our dataset will encourage the development of new analogy-making models.","tags":["multimodality"],"title":"VASR: Visual Analogies of Situation Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667779200,"objectID":"8b3b5f3b3f08c6a13954b069ab1be888","permalink":"/talk/dont_balance/","publishdate":"2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/dont_balance/","section":"talk","summary":"\nTechnion, Computational Data Science Seminar\nTel Aviv University, NLP Seminar","tags":null,"title":"On the Limitations of Dataset Balancing: The Lost Battle Against Spurious Correlations","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Michael Hassid","\u003ca href='http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hapeng/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eHao Peng\u003c/a\u003e","Daniel Rotem","\u003ca href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jkasai/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eJungo Kasai\u003c/a\u003e","Ivan Montero","\u003ca href='http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eNoah A.

In this opinion paper, we identify that despite these efforts, increasingly-powerful models keep exploiting ever-smaller spurious correlations, and as a result even balancing all single-word features is insufficient for mitigating all of these correlations. In parallel, a truly balanced dataset may be bound to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\" and miss important signal encoding common sense and world knowledge.

As a result, recent scholarship has called for better estimates of the impact of AI on greenhouse gas emissions. However, data scientists today do not have easy or reliable access to measurements of this information, which precludes consideration of how to reduce the costs (computational, electricity, environmental) associated with machine learning workloads. We argue that cloud providers presenting information about software carbon intensity to users is a fundamental stepping stone towards minimizing emissions.\nIn this paper, we provide a framework for measuring software carbon intensity, and propose to measure operational carbon emissions by using location-based and time-specific marginal emissions data per energy unit. We provide measurements of operational software carbon intensity for a set of modern models covering natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision applications, including four sizes of DenseNet models trained on MNIST, pretraining and finetuning of BERT-small, pretraining of a 6.1 billion parameter language model, and five sizes of Vision Transformer. We confirm previous results that the geographic region of the data center plays a significant role in the carbon intensity for a given cloud instance. We also present new results showing that the time of day has meaningful impact on operational software carbon intensity. We then evaluate a suite of approaches for reducing emissions in the cloud: using cloud instances in different geographic regions, using cloud instances at different times of day, and dynamically pausing cloud instances when the marginal carbon intensity is above a certain threshold. We find that choosing an appropriate region can have the largest impact, but emissions can be reduced by the other methods as well. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for how machine learning practitioners can use software carbon intensity information to reduce environmental impact.","tags":["greenai"],"title":"Measuring the Carbon Intensity of AI in Cloud instances","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Inbal Magar","\u003cb\u003eRoy Schwartz\u003c/b\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646438400,"objectID":"4f424a29b774d4d1ea69dbdfd9c9962a","permalink":"/publication/contamination/","publishdate":"2022-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/contamination/","section":"publication","summary":"Pretrained language models are typically trained on massive web-based datasets, which are often “contaminated” with downstream test sets.

However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights—an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.","tags":["greenai","understanding_models"],"title":"ABC: Attention with Bounded-memory Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003ca href='https://lambdaviking.com' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eWill Merrill\u003c/a\u003e","\u003ca href='https://vkramanuj.github.io/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eVivek Ramanujan\u003c/a\u003e","\u003ca href='https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eYoav Goldberg\u003c/a\u003e","\u003cb\u003eRoy Schwartz\u003c/b\u003e","\u003ca href='http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eNoah A.

Evidence is emerging that they learn successfully due to inductive bias in the training routine, typically a variant of gradient descent (GD). To better understand this bias, we study the tendency for transformer parameters to grow in magnitude (l2 norm) during training, and its implications for the emergent representations within self attention layers. Empirically, we document norm growth in the training of transformer language models, including T5 during its pretraining. As the parameters grow in magnitude, we prove that the network approximates a discretized network with saturated activation functions. Such \"saturated\" networks are known to have a reduced capacity compared to the full network family that can be described in terms of formal languages and automata. Our results suggest saturation is a new characterization of an inductive bias implicit in GD of particular interest for NLP. We leverage the emergent discrete structure in a saturated transformer to analyze the role of different attention heads, finding that some focus locally on a small number of positions, while other heads compute global averages, allowing counting.

In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text. In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting. First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation, leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned representation.

Our analysis focuses on the role of \"assertions\": contexts within raw text that provide indirect clues about underlying semantics. We study whether assertions enable a system to emulate representations preserving semantic relations like equivalence. We find that assertions enable semantic emulation if all expressions in the language are referentially transparent.

Finally, we discuss differences between our formal model and natural language, exploring how our results generalize to a modal setting and other semantic relations.

While most contrast sets were created manually, requiring intensive annotation effort, we present a novel method which leverages rich semantic input representation to automatically generate contrast sets for the visual question answering task.

This yields two intuitive measures for each example---the model's confidence in the true class, and the variability of this confidence across epochs, in a single run of training. Experiments on four datasets show that these model-dependent measures reveal three distinct regions in the data map, each with pronounced characteristics.

At the time of this writing the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) has amassed over 128K relevant papers, both historical and cutting-edge. In this emergency scenario, there is a need for automatic information extraction (IE) to provide scientists with structured knowledge, and to accelerate exploration and discovery.\nIn this work we extract relations capturing a broad notion of mechanisms in CORD-19 papers \u0026ndash; Spanning a range of mechanisms as diverse as psychological intervention techniques, computational algorithms, and molecular mechanisms of viral cell entry. This unified view of natural and artificial mechanisms can help generalize across the CORD-19 corpus and is designed to help scale the study of the many different types of processes, activities and functions described in the dataset.\nWe collect a set of annotations from domain experts for direct mechanisms (operations and functions explicitly described in the text) and indirect mechanisms (observed effects and interactions without an explicit description of a direct functional relation). For example, descriptions of the mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to cells, or of a diagnostic procedure based on computer vision \u0026ndash; are considered direct mechanisms. Conversely, descriptions of indirect mechanisms can for example be of observed links between COVID-19 and certain symptoms, with no explicit mention of the functional process leading from the disease to the symptoms. This distinction between direct and indirect relations is inspired by a review of biomedical and scientific ontologies (e.g., direct and indirect regulation of proteins by chemicals).\nWe allow annotators to select free-form text spans as the arguments in our mechanism relations; this is in contrast to many existing datasets of annotated scientific relations which are often entity-centric (e.g., protein-chemical interactions). We do so in order to capture the complexity and diversity of the many concepts and ideas described in the corpus, in a scalable approach. To address the challenging nature of the annotation task with multiple \"correct\" annotations of complex and diverse spans, we conduct a multi-round annotation process with final adjudication by a domain expert experienced in bioNLP annotations.\nOur annotations are used in combination with existing datasets from different domains to train a relation extraction model, using a mapping schema for previously introduced scientific datasets,selecting only direct and indirect mechanisms (e.g.,DIRECT UP-REGULATION in the chemprot dataset) and unifying relation labels into our typology using a domain expert. Our results indicate we outperform baselines including openIE and SRL, and also supervised models trained on related science IE datasets in the biomedical and computer science domains. We use a biomedical language model that we fine-tune to capture semantic similarity, build a graph of similar mechanisms and induce concepts by finding cliques. To support search over our KB, we use the same language model for retrieving relations similar to the query.

We propose a general method to embed multiple knowledge bases(KBs) into large scale models, and there by enhance their representations with structured, human-curated knowledge. For each KB, we first use an integrated entity linker to retrieve relevant entity embeddings, then update contextual word representations via a form of word-to-entity attention. In contrast to previous approaches, the entity linkers and self-supervised language modeling objective are jointly trained end-to-end in a multitask setting that combines a small amount of entity linking supervision with a large amount of raw text. After integrating WordNet and a subset of Wikipedia into BERT, the knowledge enhanced BERT (KnowBert) demonstrates improved perplexity, ability to recall facts as measured in a probing task and downstream performance on relationship extraction, entity typing, and word sense disambiguation. KnowBert’s runtime is comparable to BERT’sand it scales to large KBs.","tags":["word_representations"],"title":"Knowledge Enhanced Contextual Word Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003ca href='http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hapeng/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eHao Peng\u003c/a\u003e","\u003cb\u003eRoy Schwartz\u003c/b\u003e","\u003ca href='http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eNoah A.

We take advantage of rational RNNs’ natural grouping of the weights, so the group lasso penalty directly removes WFSA states, substantially reducing the number of parameters in the model. Our experiments on a number of sentiment analysis datasets, using both GloVe and BERT embeddings, show that our approach learns neural structures which have fewer parameters without sacrificing performance relative to parameter-rich baselines. Our method also highlights the interpretable properties of rational RNNs.

We argue for reporting additional details, especially performance on validation data obtained during model development.

Using our approach, we find multiple recent model comparisons where authors would have reached a different conclusion if they had used more (or less) computation. Our approach also allows us to estimate the amount of computation required to obtain a given accuracy; applying it to several recently published results yields massive variation across papers, from hours to weeks.

In word similarity tasks for each word class, we show that our framework is both effective and efficient. Particularly, it improves the Spearman's rho correlation with human scores on SimLex-999 over the best previously proposed class-specific contexts by 6 (A), 6 (V) and 5 (N) rho points. With our selected context configurations, we train on only 14% (A), 26.2% (V), and 33.6% (N) of all dependency-based contexts, resulting in a reduced training time. Our results generalise: we show that the configurations our algorithm learns for one English training setup outperform previously proposed context types in another training setup for English. Moreover, basing the configuration space on universal dependencies, it is possible to transfer the learned configurations to German and Italian.

However, their quality decreases substantially for the task of verb similarity prediction. In this paper we show that using symmetric pattern contexts (SPs, e.g., ``X and Y'') improves word2vec verb similarity performance by up to 15% and is also instrumental in adjective similarity prediction. The unsupervised SP contexts are even superior to a variety of dependency contexts extracted using a supervised dependency parser. Moreover, we observe that SPs and dependency coordination contexts (Coor) capture a similar type of information, and demonstrate that Coor contexts are superior to other dependency contexts including the set of all dependency contexts, although they are still inferior to SPs. Finally, there are substantially fewer SP contexts compared to alternative representations, leading to a massive reduction in training time. On an 8G words corpus and a 32 core machine, the SP model trains in 11 minutes, compared to 5 and 11 hours with BOW and all dependency contexts, respectively.","tags":["word_representations"],"title":"Symmetric Patterns and Coordinations: Fast and Enhanced Representations of Verbs and Adjectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eRoy Schwartz\u003c/b\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"0f40cf545adf79432be77d9037b7794b","permalink":"/publication/thesis/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["word_representations"],"title":"Pattern-based methods for Improved Lexical Semantics and Word Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"efb082ee0a992cc8565a3b08a0d42f23","permalink":"/talk/pattern-based_solutions/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pattern-based_solutions/","section":"talk","summary":"Intel Inc.

We employ four state-of-the-art DMs as sources of feature representation for this task, and show that they all yield poor results when tested on attributive properties, achieving no more than an average F-score of 0.37 in the binary property prediction task, compared to 0.73 on taxonomic properties.

For this aim we automatically acquire SPs (e.g., 'X and Y') from a large corpus of plain text, and generate vectors where each coordinate represents the co-occurrence in SPs of the represented word with another word of the vocabulary. Our representation has three advantages over existing alternatives: First, being based on symmetric word relationships, it is highly suitable for word similarity prediction. Particularly, on the SimLex999 word similarity dataset, our model achieves a Spearman's \u0026#961; score of 0.517, compared to 0.462 of the state-of-the-art word2vec model. Interestingly, our model performs exceptionally well on verbs, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 20.2\u0026#x2012;41.5%. Second, pattern features can be adapted to the needs of a target NLP application. For example, we show that we can easily control whether the embeddings derived from SPs deem antonym pairs (e.g. (big,small)) as similar or dissimilar, an important distinction for tasks such as word classification and sentiment analysis. Finally, we show that a simple combination of the word similarity scores generated by our method and by word2vec results in a superior predictive power over that of each individual model, scoring as high as 0.563 in Spearman's \u0026#961; on SimLex999. This emphasizes the differences between the signals captured by each of the models.","tags":["word_representations"],"title":"Symmetric Pattern Based Word Embeddings for Improved Word Similarity Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1422748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422748800,"objectID":"0fc9851e88f6a985877336c58da6b7cb","permalink":"/talk/semantic_knowledge/","publishdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/semantic_knowledge/","section":"talk","summary":"The Catalonia-Israel Symposium on Lexical Semantics and Grammatical Structure","tags":null,"title":"Semantic Knowledge Acquisition using Frequency Based Patterns","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"efd0c4db9e70a844e3002aa090a475ea","permalink":"/talk/acquiring_semantic/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/acquiring_semantic/","section":"talk","summary":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem; CS Learning Semanir","tags":null,"title":"Acquiring Semantic Knowledge using Patterns","type":"talk"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eRoy Schwartz\u003c/b\u003e","\u003ca href='http://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eRoi Reichart\u003c/a\u003e","\u003ca href='http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~arir/' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eAri Rappoport\u003c/a\u003e"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1404172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404172800,"objectID":"d9563020ab84f7e55132ec38685a3b71","permalink":"/publication/coarse_grained/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coarse_grained/","section":"publication","summary":"Classifying nouns into semantic categories (e.g., animals, food) is an important line of research in both cognitive science and natural language processing.

Our methodology compares pairs of annotation schemes that differ in the annotation of a single structure. It selects the more learnable scheme, namely the one that can be better learned using statistical parsers. We find that in three of the structures, one annotation is unequivocally better than the alternatives. Our results are consistent over various settings involving five parsers and two definitions of learnability. Furthermore, we show that the learnability gains incurred by our selections are both considerable (error reductions of up to 19.8%) and additive.
